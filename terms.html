					<p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Effective Date: 2025/05/01<br />Last Updated: 2025/05/23</p>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Acceptance of Terms</h2>
						<p>By accessing or using Yarsha (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;the App&quot;), you
							agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;). If you do not agree, please
							do not use Yarsha. Yarsha is a beta chat application that enables secure messaging and
							allows users to send, receive, and store Solana-based tokens by interacting with Blinks
							(Solana on-chain action links) via chat.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">By using Yarsha, you also consent to the processing and transmission of certain
							user data to our servers, as detailed in our <a class="text-blue-600 underline"
								href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Who Can Use Yarsha</h2>
						<p>You must be at least 17 years old, or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use
							Yarsha. By using the App, you confirm that you meet this requirement.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Consent and Data Usage</h2>
						<p>When you grant permissions to access features such as your camera, contacts, location, or
							microphone, we may collect and upload data to our secure servers to enable core
							functionality (e.g., encrypted messaging, sending media, user discovery). This only occurs
							after you provide explicit device-level or in-app consent.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">You can revoke access at any time through your device settings. All data
							handling practices are outlined in our <a class="text-blue-600 underline"
								href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Account Registration, Use & Responsibility</h2>
						<p>To use Yarsha, you may be required to register for an account using your phone number. You
							agree to provide accurate and complete information and to keep this information up to date.
							You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and any associated
							credentials. Do not share your credentials with others. You are solely liable for all
							activities that occur under your account.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Wallet Creation and Management</h2>
						<p>When you first verify your phone number via OTP, Yarsha automatically generates a new Solana
							wallet (public/private key pair) using the Solana SDK. Your private key is encrypted
							immediately using industry-standard encryption protocols such as AES-256 and securely stored
							in our backend systems—only the encrypted form is ever written to disk. Once the wallet is
							created, only your decrypted public address and private key are transmitted back to your
							device. Yarsha does not store or have access to the decrypted private key. You are solely
							responsible for maintaining control over your device and securing any backup credentials. If
							you lose access to your phone or OTP verification method, you may permanently lose access to
							your wallet and any assets it contains. Yarsha is not liable for any loss of funds resulting
							from unauthorized access, lost devices, forgotten credentials, or user error. All
							transactions made through Yarsha are executed on the Solana blockchain and are irreversible.
							Users are advised to exercise caution when sending or receiving tokens.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What You Cannot Do</h2>
						<p>You agree not to use Yarsha to send spam or unauthorized advertisements, harass, impersonate,
							or threaten others, share or promote illegal, violent, or abusive content, violate
							applicable laws or sanctions, or exploit vulnerabilities or disrupt Yarsha&#x27;s services.
							We may suspend or permanently disable accounts that violate these Terms.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Core Features</h2>
						<p>Yarsha allows you to communicate via end-to-end encrypted chat, send and receive Solana-based
							tokens, share and execute Solana Blinks within chat, participate in token-enabled chat
							groups, and distribute airdrops in group conversations.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">Note: All blockchain interactions are conducted on the Solana network and are
							irreversible.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Blockchain Disclaimer</h2>
						<p>Yarsha facilitates blockchain-based actions (e.g., token transfers, Blinks). These
							transactions are final and cannot be reversed or edited once confirmed on-chain.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">We are not responsible for:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
							<li>Mistaken transfers</li>
							<li>Loss of funds due to user error</li>
							<li>Network outages or Solana-related issues</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="mt-4">Please double-check all wallet addresses and token actions before confirming.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Third-Party Integrations</h2>
						<p>Yarsha integrates with third-party services to support app functionality, performance
							monitoring, diagnostics, and user verification. These include Firebase Analytics and
							Crashlytics, Twilio, Sentry, and Google Cloud Storage. These providers may process limited
							usage or diagnostic data under secure agreements and their own privacy policies.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Collection</h2>
						<p>Yarsha may collect personal or device-level data depending on your OS and permission
							settings. On Android, this includes internet access, biometric input, media, external
							storage, camera, contacts, and push tokens. On iOS, this includes camera, contacts, Face ID,
							location, photos, microphone, and Apple Music activity. Data is used strictly for
							functionality, diagnostics, and security—not for advertising.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">This data may be uploaded to Yarsha servers or third-party systems to power core
							features, only after your explicit permission has been granted.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Beta Software Notice</h2>
						<p>Yarsha is currently in beta. Features may change, break, or be removed. We make no guarantees
							regarding reliability, performance, or uptime during this phase. We are not liable for any
							losses arising from using Yarsha in its beta state. You are receiving early access to a beta
							version of our app, distributed via Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Updates to These Terms</h2>
						<p>We may update these Terms periodically. Any material changes will be communicated to users.
							Continued use of Yarsha after updates means you accept the new Terms.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-8">
						<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Termination of Service</h2>
						<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to Yarsha at any time, with or without
							notice, particularly for violations of these Terms or harmful behavior.</p>
